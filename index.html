    I am Snehal Malhotra, born and raised in Faridabad itself and currently pursuing my Btech degree from JC Bose university, YMCA.
    I am a 3rd year Electronics and Computer Engineer student, being passionate about learning new techniques and skills.
    I have been an academically sound student throughout my academic life. I love to participate and volunteer in various webinars and competitions. Recently I have volunteered in a national level Returning Mothers Conference being held by IEEE
    KERALA SECTION. Currently my only goal is to enhance my knowledge in different domains and to utilise it in the practical use. My hobbies include sketching/painting and occasionally I go for singing also. Currently I am the Class Representative
    of my class. Chairperson of the IEEE Women in engineering Affinity group and also The Joint secretary of the IEEE Student branch of the university. I am also a member of the organising committee of the International Affairs Cell, I usually go for
    the anchoring of the event which helped me a lot to overcome stage fear and at the same time helped me in improving my communication skills.
